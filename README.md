# Rodent Burrows Detection Project

## Project Overviews

This project aims to detect rodent burrows using semantic segmentation techniques.

## Objectives

- Utilize semantic segmentation for rodent burrow detection.
- Improve detection accuracy, especially in complex backgrounds.
- Provide technical support for pest management and grassland restoration.

## Framework Used

- [MMSegmentation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation): An open-source framework for image segmentation.

## Dataset

The project uses a custom rodent burrows dataset.
